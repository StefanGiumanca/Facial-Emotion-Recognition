# 🧠 Facial Emotion & Liveness Recognition

**Facial Emotion & Liveness Recognition** is a high-performance Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) application for real-time FER, optimized for low-latency web environments. Built on PyTorch using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 architecture and Transfer Learning. Key achievements include implementing geometric Anti-Spoofing (Liveness Detection) and optimizing the model for 93.45% accuracy via specialized data handling techniques.  

## 🧠 Training the Model (Optional)

The emotion classification model was trained using the **FER+ (Facial Expression Recognition Plus)** dataset, a widely-used dataset for facial emotion recognition tasks.

📁 The training script is available in this repo as: train_model.py

### 📂 Dataset Info

- Dataset used: **FER+** (you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013))
- Images are grayscale, 48x48 pixels, with labeled facial emotions.
- The dataset is split into `train` and `test`.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to high storage memory. Please download it manually if you want to retrain the model.

### 🚀 How to Train

To retrain the model locally:

```bash
python train_model.py
```
🧪 After training, the model will be saved as: models/emotion_model_best.pt

## 🚀 Try It Online

▶️ Test in your browser, no installation needed:

👉 https://huggingface.co/spaces/Giumi10/facial-emotion-recognition

Just allow camera access and the app will start automatically.

⚠️ Performance Note
This demo runs on a Free Cloud CPU. Due to hardware limitations, the processing speed is optimized for stability rather than high frame rates. You may experience slight latency.
